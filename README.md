# More Native Radio Wheels for GTAV

[Download page](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/more-radio-wheels#description_tab)

This script is meant for users that have a ton of real add-on radios installed. Instead of having your radio wheel look like [this](https://img.gta5-mods.com/q95/images/community-hud-gfx-for-add-on-radio-stations/44d2d1-radiomemes.png), you can split all your stations into [smaller wheels](https://img.gta5-mods.com/q95/images/more-radio-wheels/e2305b-Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Screenshot_2019.01.26_-_20.06.38.71.png).

## Features
* Organize stations into separate wheels
* Completely hide stations you dislike

## Contributing

There are no dependencies except for [ScriptHookV](http://dev-c.com/GTAV/scripthookv). Place the SDK in the same directory as this repository, i.e.

```
+-- MoreRadioWheels/
|----- MoreRadioWheels.sln
|----- MoreRadioWheels/
+-- ScriptHookV_SDK/
|----- lib/
|----- inc/
```
